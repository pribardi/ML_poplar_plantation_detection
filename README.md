# ENSEEIHT Toulouse INP Long Project - IATI: Poplar Plantation Detection Using Random Forests and Super Resolution Evaluation for Enhanced Classification Performance

This project, led by a team composed of Mohamed E., Auriane B., Maroua A., and Pierre R., aimed to assess the enhancement brought by Super Resolution to the classification of Poplar plantations through Random Forest models applied to Remote Sensing images of France. The project spanned six weeks and was supervised by Dr. Yousra Hamrouni and Prof. David Sheeren from the DYNAFOR Laboratory.
